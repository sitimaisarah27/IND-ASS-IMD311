                    Everything serves a purpose. Humans are the best creation, and each individual is unique. As a result of writing about myself, I'm here to express myself about what I see, what I experience, and what I intend to do with my life. I strive to be modest, passionate, devoted, hardworking, and truthful.

                    My name is Siti Maisarah Binti Faizal. I am a semester 5 student in university. I am the oldest among my siblings. i have three younger sisters and one younger brother. Being the eldest one, sometimes, gives you the favors. Luckily, I am loved, cared and most favored upon in my all family. I am 21 years old and currently enrolled at UITM Kelantan. I am a self-motivated and self-driven student. Once my father said to me that "Education is the most powerful weapon, one can conquer all hurdles of life using knowledge".
                    In my early years, I had little interest in my studies. My parents used to encourage and motivate me to study, but I never understood their concern for my future. It is said that time heals and teaches lessons that no one else can.

                    I have many friends, but only a few know my secrets and feelings. None of them are intimate or close friends. When I encounter a problem, I seek their assistance. During exams, I call and invite a few classmates to a group study session. We study together and individually to understand the topics. I take good care of myself. I keep myself clean and tidy, and I try not to play in dirt or dust. I consume healthy foods such as fruits and green leafy vegetables, as well as fresh fruit juices. A healthy body indicates a healthy mind. 
                    My good health allows me to study on a regular basis and complete all tasks efficiently.

                    I have always looked up to the freedom fighters as role models and aspire to be like them. I am inspired by their enthusiasm, energy, and vitality in winning various battles throughout their lives and making the world a better place, as it is today. Thus, how we master ourselves to look into a beautiful future is in our hands, and I truly believe in this. Best wishes to all of my friends".
